# This is the file Jetty will try to load when you execute its "$JETTY_HOME/bin/jetty.sh" 
# script (does not apply for "java -jar start.jar", which then you should passs
# all relevant information by hand, and we don't cover it here). 
# As of Jetty 8, the "$JETTY_HOME/bin/jetty.sh" script will, by default, try read these settings
# from the following files:
#
# 	1) /etc/default/jetty
# 	2) $HOME/.jettyrc
#
# So in practice you can rename this file to any of those two. However, please
# keep in mind that if you have more than one Jetty service running in the same
# machine or user, that Jetty will also read these settings, which could lead
# to unexpected problems (a good example is using one Jetty for the Webapp, and other for Solr).
# 
# In such case, you may do something like this: save this file as $JETTY_HOME/jetty_config, and add 
# the following like to your $JETTY_HOME/bin/jetty.sh:
#
# source "$(readlink -f $0 | xargs dirname)/../jetty_config"
#
# That way, you can have different settings for different Jettys. 
#
# ATTENTION: You *should* export the VARIABLES, otherwise something may not work correctly 
#

export JETTY_PORT=8080
export JETTY_RUN=/tmp/jetty.8080

# You may also want to define these here:
#
#export JETTY_HOME=/opt/jetty
#export APACHE_HOST_CONF=/etc/httpd/conf.d/example.conf
